This repository showcases a chatbot website I developed. I then modified it by customizeing the Google Gemini API with tailored system instructions to optimize its functionality. Additionally, I integrated a button leveraging the Web Speech API to provide robust text-to-speech capabilities, significantly enhancing user engagement and accessibility. The frontend is constructed using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, ensuring a responsive design and an aesthetically pleasing user interface.
